# MCTS-Kaggle
Solution for Kaggle Competition: UM-Game Playing Strength of MCTS Variants

This project includes two separate code implementations: one designed for local execution and another specifically tailored for the Kaggle competition environment.

## Local Code Usage
### Required Files:
train.csv
test.csv
importances_3.csv
These files must be located in the same directory as the local code.

### Execution Steps:
Open the file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Select Python 3.12.7 as the kernel if possible.
Click on "Run All" to execute all cells.

### Details:
Processing the dataset is time-consuming, and the execution time can be long.
Therefore, the sampling rate is set to 5% in the local code for faster execution.
For more accurate and effective results, the sampling rate can be increased.

## Kaggle Code Usage
The Kaggle code is specifically designed to run in the competition environment.
Outputs are pre-saved and require no additional configuration.
Ensure the correct dataset and configurations are loaded before execution.
